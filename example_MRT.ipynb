    "# Using our Modified Ray-Tracer\n",
    "Here we demonstrate how to use our modified ray-tracer (MRT).  For more in-depth discussion of the MRT's inner workings, see our extensive report.\n",
    "\n",
    "**We want to emphasize that the point of our MRT is the *modifications*, not the underlying ray-tracer.**  Why?  Because the underlying ray-tracer is quite simple, and doesn't have any fancy bells and whistles (e.g., textures and reflection) that you can find in other ray-tracers.  The underlying ray-tracer is also inefficient.  (Case-and-point, it's written in Python rather than, say, Julia or C++.)  **We used the underlying ray-tracer merely as a vehicle to explore and test our modifications.**\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, we'll now demonstrate how our MRT can be used.  **See our report for more information, including:** (1) references for more in-depth descriptions and discussions of ray-tracing itself and (2) in-depth discussion of the modifications of our MRT, as well as (4) discussion of performance and (5) suggestions for future improvements and implementation within much more advanced ray-tracers.\n",

    "Next, let's build the scene we want to render.  Our underlying ray-tracer has support for adding spheres and planes with non-reflective surfaces, as well as point light sources.  This selection was sufficient for our modification tests.  If you like, you could certainly go and add more complex lights and objects yourself (e.g., cubes and reflective surfaces) to the underlying code (\"func_MRT.py\").  The underlying class-based ray-tracer is \"roomy\", in the sense that it was built for possible expansion later on.  Some included functionality (such as paths for the light sources) are not used here, but were put in specifically for later expansions of the code."
